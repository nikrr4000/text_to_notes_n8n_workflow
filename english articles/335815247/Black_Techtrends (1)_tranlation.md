Learning management systems, or LMSs, have become a cornerstone of modern education, especially in online and blended learning environments. While there are many brands and platforms available, the reality is that most LMSs offer very similar core functionalities—things like quizzes, discussion forums, grading tools, scheduling, and collaborative workspaces. In fact, research suggests that the technical differences between these systems are minimal, and that many distinctions come down more to marketing than meaningful innovation. As a result, the authors of this article argue that institutions should shift their focus away from *which* LMS to choose, and instead concentrate on the often-overlooked challenge of *how* to successfully adopt and implement the system—what they call “the other side of the LMS.”

The central problem the paper addresses is the gap between having an LMS and actually using it effectively. Despite widespread availability, many institutions struggle with low faculty adoption and inconsistent implementation. The authors propose that this isn’t due to flaws in the software itself, but rather to human and organizational factors. Their main hypothesis is that successful integration of an LMS depends less on its features and more on how well it aligns with institutional culture, teaching practices, and user needs.

To explore this, the authors draw on Everett Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations theory, applying five key attributes—compatibility, relative advantage, trialability, observability, and complexity—to the context of LMS adoption. They explain that for faculty to embrace an LMS, it must be compatible with their teaching styles and content areas. A biology professor needs virtual labs; a writing instructor needs peer review tools. When the system doesn’t support these needs, resistance grows. Similarly, the relative advantage—the perceived benefit over traditional methods—must be clear. Yet many faculty see disadvantages: high time investment, lack of compensation, and concerns over intellectual property, all of which reduce motivation to adopt.

The paper also emphasizes the importance of allowing trialability—letting instructors test the system in low-risk settings, such as blended courses, before moving to fully online instruction. Observability, or seeing others succeed with the LMS, is another powerful driver. When faculty witness peers effectively using the platform, or when success stories are shared widely, adoption increases. Conversely, visible failures—like lost student exam responses—can severely damage trust and stall progress.

Support is highlighted as a critical but often underestimated factor. Technical problems, poor customer service, and lack of institutional backing can undermine even the best systems. The authors stress that user satisfaction hinges not just on functionality, but on the quality of support provided throughout the adoption process.

In conclusion, the authors assert that while LMSs are technically standardized, the path to successful implementation is anything but. They recommend that change agents—those leading the rollout—focus on strategic planning, thorough research, and learning from other institutions. They should assess their own institutional goals, create realistic timelines, and prioritize support structures. Ultimately, the success of an LMS depends not on its brand or features, but on thoughtful, user-centered implementation.

This work contributes significantly to the field by reframing the conversation around LMSs. Its main strength lies in shifting the focus from technology to people—highlighting that adoption is a social and organizational challenge, not just a technical one. However, a limitation is that the recommendations, while practical, may be difficult to implement in under-resourced institutions. Still, the article provides a valuable roadmap for educators and administrators aiming to move beyond mere access to meaningful integration of learning technologies.
